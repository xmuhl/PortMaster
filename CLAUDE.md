# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

### Primary Build Process
- **Build command**: `autobuild.bat` - Automatically detects VS2022 installation, builds all configurations (Win32/x64, Debug/Release) with zero errors and zero warnings enforcement
- **Build requirements**: Visual Studio 2022 (Community/Professional/Enterprise) with v143 toolset
- **Build outputs**: Static-linked MFC application, single EXE deployment target

### Build Verification
- All builds must achieve **zero errors and zero warnings** before proceeding
- Build logs are generated as `msbuild_*.log` files for detailed analysis
- The build script enforces `/p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true` for quality assurance

## Architecture Overview

### Core Design Pattern
PortMaster follows a **layered architecture** with clear separation between transport, protocol, and application layers:

```
Application Layer (MFC UI)
    ↓
Protocol Layer (Reliable Channel + Frame Codec)
    ↓  
Transport Layer (ITransport implementations)
    ↓
Hardware/OS Layer (Serial/LPT/Network/USB)
```

### Key Architectural Components

**Transport Layer (`Transport/`)**
- `ITransport` - Unified interface for all communication channels
- Multiple concrete implementations: Serial (COM), LPT (via Windows print spooler), USB Printers, TCP/UDP networking, Loopback testing
- Each transport handles its own connection management, buffering, and error handling
- Async I/O support via callback mechanisms

**Protocol Layer (`Protocol/`)**  
- `ReliableChannel` - Implements custom reliable transmission protocol over any ITransport
- `FrameCodec` - Handles frame encoding/decoding with format: `0xAA55 + Type + Sequence + Length + CRC32 + Data + 0x55AA`
- `CRC32` - IEEE 802.3 standard implementation (polynomial 0xEDB88320)
- Frame types: START (with file metadata), DATA, END, ACK, NAK
- State machine: Sender (Idle→Starting→Sending→Ending→Done), Receiver (Idle→Ready→Receiving→Done)

**Common Utilities (`Common/`)**
- `ConfigManager` - JSON-based configuration persistence (program directory first, fallback to %LOCALAPPDATA%)
- `RingBuffer` - Auto-expanding circular buffer for data streaming
- `IOWorker` - OVERLAPPED I/O completion port worker for Windows async operations

### State Management Patterns
- Transport states: `TRANSPORT_CLOSED`, `TRANSPORT_OPENING`, `TRANSPORT_OPEN`, `TRANSPORT_CLOSING`, `TRANSPORT_ERROR`
- Protocol states: `RELIABLE_IDLE`, `RELIABLE_STARTING`, `RELIABLE_SENDING`, `RELIABLE_ENDING`, `RELIABLE_READY`, `RELIABLE_RECEIVING`, `RELIABLE_DONE`, `RELIABLE_FAILED`
- Frame types: `FRAME_START`, `FRAME_DATA`, `FRAME_END`, `FRAME_ACK`, `FRAME_NAK`

### Threading Model
- Each transport may spawn its own background threads for I/O operations
- Protocol layer runs state machine in dedicated thread with condition variable synchronization
- UI thread remains responsive through callback-based event delivery
- Thread-safe operations using std::atomic, std::mutex, and proper RAII patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Layered error propagation: Transport → Protocol → Application
- CRC validation at protocol layer with automatic NAK/retransmission
- Timeout-based recovery mechanisms with configurable retry limits
- Graceful degradation: protocol layer can be disabled for direct transport access

### Configuration Architecture
- Multi-tier storage: Transport-specific configs, protocol parameters, UI state, application settings
- Automatic persistence on shutdown with corruption recovery
- Default value fallbacks for all configuration parameters
- Support for per-transport-type parameter sets

## Development Notes

### Code Standards
- **Language**: All code, comments, and resources in Simplified Chinese
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 with BOM, `#pragma execution_character_set("utf-8")` where needed
- **Compatibility**: Windows 7-11 support, both x86 and x64 architectures
- **Deployment**: Single EXE with static MFC linking (`/MT` runtime)

### Protocol Implementation Details
- Frame size limit: 1024 bytes payload (configurable via `FrameCodec::SetMaxPayloadSize`)
- Sliding window size: 1 (stop-and-wait ARQ for simplicity)
- File transfer includes metadata: filename (UTF-8), file size, modification time
- Received files auto-saved with collision resolution (numeric suffixes)

### Transport Layer Extension Points
To add new transport types:
1. Implement `ITransport` interface
2. Handle state transitions consistently
3. Implement async callback patterns
4. Add configuration parameters to `TransportConfig`
5. Register with `ConfigManager` for persistence

### UI Integration Patterns
- Transport selection via combo box with dynamic port enumeration
- Dual-view data display (hexadecimal and text representations)
- File drag-drop support for transmission
- Real-time progress reporting via callback mechanisms
- Splash screen integration during application startup
